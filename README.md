# NewsBit: Correlating News Coverage Sentiment and Bitcoin Prices
## Overview

NewsBit is a project aiming to build a model to establish a correlation between the sentiment of news coverage and Bitcoin prices. The team will use Python and R for data collection, cleaning, and analysis. The project comprises multiple phases, including data collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development and evaluation, and data visualization.

## Phases
1. Project Planning and Scoping: Finalize the project scope and create a project plan.
2. Data Collection: Collect news articles and determine their relevance.
3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and format the data.
4. Data Exploration: Analyze and visualize the data, understand its nature, and manually label a subset of articles.
5. Data Modeling: Select appropriate classification models, perform feature engineering, and train the model.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate, test, and tune the model.
7. Data Analysis & Visualization: Analyze the classified data and visualize its distribution.
8. Bitcoin Price Movement Tracking: Import daily price movement data and identify days of interest.
9. Building the Correlation Model: Test different correlation models and identify any correlation in price changes with delays.
10. Building the Prediction Model: Build a prediction model based on the findings from previous phases.
11. Research Paper Submission: Compile research and findings in a professional report.
